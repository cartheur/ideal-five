A new robotic operating paradigm of embodied autonomy conforming to artificial life.

### Background

From visions in 1987 to initial scoping in 2003, not until 2024 has a programming paradigm been discretely determined wherein a robot can be fully autonomous and ascribe those sets of behaviours we classify as being _alive_.

### System Architecture

* Layer Zero: Operations
* Layer One: Command Interpreter
* Layer Two: Memory Management Module
* Layer Three: I/O
* Layer Four: Feedback

### Tasks

* Construct a glossary of _words_ required by the instance. [Here](https://forth-standard.org/standard/core) is an example, if not outdated.
* Enable the correct vocabulary that initates _control_.
* Enable an appropriate vocabulary that mitgates _choice_.
* Enable an appropriate vocabulary that allows external hardware.
* Define the correlation of MPU6050 streaming data covering six dimensions, two volumes to predict the ninth (third).
